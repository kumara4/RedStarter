RedStarter - HW3 
Four Scenarios: 
1.	On the login page (which is now our home page), user can sign up and their data is saved on Firebase. User can also log in on the same page and be taken to the landing page. 
2.	The user will be able to search subreddits by entering key terms into the search box
3.	The user will be able to connect their account to Facebook to get suggestions based on their Facebook likes
4.	The user will be able to search specific Reddit categories (top, trending, hot, new etc.) and be presented with data on specific subreddits that are trending within that category (D3 Visualization)
5.	The user will be able to click on any subreddit and follow them
6.	The user will be able to see information about a subreddit by clicking on it, such as number of followers
7.	The user will be able to navigate to a subreddit on a new tab by clicking on a button next to the title.
8.	User is able to view summaries of popular subreddit sections.

Two scenarios we implemented:
1.	When user signs up for a new account their log in info (name, email, username and passwords) are stored in the Firebase database. 
2.	User is able to view summaries of popular subreddit sections.

HW5:

Step 1: Visualization
Landing.html contains two d3 visuals. One is a visual of subreddit posts that dynamically changes based on size and count so that the user can see which posts are more popular. -Henry

The second visual is the results of the search function. When the user enters a series of terms, the subreddits results are
presented in a circle graph where the biggest circles are the most popualr subreddits by subscribers -Henry

Step 2: Move third scenario into React
Third scenario that was implmeneted with react was the search feature. It has three components where two of the components are children.-Henry
Login menu was converted to React - Asmita



HW6 -

Ashmita - Write tests for landing.html which contains all the content the user can interact with
Henry - Get login and signup to check that existing users cant sign up again and new users dont get usernames that already exist. Go to landing if successful login or signup
        - Test Login and signup with jasmine

        Jasmine tests are located in login.html and landing.html
